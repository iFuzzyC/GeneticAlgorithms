The code present in this folder refers to the algorithm on the previous folder, but applied to the function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2, where
we visualize the behaviour of the GA for the 2D case.

The optimal point, given by the user in case he already knows, is shown in red. The green point represents the best member
of the population for the given generation. If the green dot can't be seen, its probably because it is too close to the red one.

Here we show only the end of the GA, the user can run the code to see the animation happening.
